## Algebra
### Equation
#### Quadratic Formula
$$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

#### Quadratic Formula of Cubic Equation
$$\begin{matrix}x_1x_2x_3 = -\frac{d}{a}\\
x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_2x_3 = \frac{c}{a}\\
x_1+x_2+x_3 = -\frac{b}{a}
\end{matrix}$$
They are derived from $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0$

#### Fractional Equation
```ad-note
denominator is NEVER zero
```

### Function
#### Linear Function
Usually, we see the linear function as $y = ax + b$, however, we can do some algebra to make it like this
$$ax+by+c = 0$$
- The x-axis intercept is $(-\frac{c}{a},0)$
- The y-axis intercept is $(0,-\frac{c}{b})$
- The slope is $-\frac{a}{b}$

#### Quadratic Function
$$ax^2+bx+c$$
Symmetric axis: $x = -\frac{b}{a}$

#### Exponential Functions
Usually, $$y=a^x$$ where $a$ is a constant that $a>0$ and $a\neq1$, the domain of definition is $R$
- [ ] What is a domain of definition?

- When $0<a<1$, the graph of the function is monotonically decreasing
- When $a>1$, the graph of the function is monotonically increasing

$y=a^x$ is symmetrical to $y=(\frac{1}{a})^x$ by $y$

$$\begin{matrix}
a^{m+n}=a^ma^n\\
a^{mn}=(a^m)^n\\
a^{\frac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a}
\end{matrix}$$
