- The Magnetic North pole acts as positive charge, South pole acts as negative charge.
- The unit of Magnetic Field $B$ is T (Tesla)

### The Magnetic force on a moving charge
##### Use the Right-Hand Rule
![[right-hand.png]]

Example: if the Magnetic field(B) toward into the page (X), if a proton moving toward top of page, then the magnetic force towards left
- Note: If the charge is negative (e-/electron), then use Left-Hand Rule (or opposite of Right-Hand Rule) 
$$ \vec{F_B} = q\vec{v} \otimes B$$
Or with magnitude:
$$F_B  = |q|vB\sin \theta$$
This equation show if the charge is at rest. Also, if **v** is parallel (or anti-parallel) to **B**, then $F_B = 0$.
The magnetic force is maximized when **v**  is perpendicular to **B**, since if $\theta= 90˚$ 

- Example: If the proton's direction shows as below, how do the proton move?
![[qcircle.png]]
- Solution: 
This image shows that the force is initially to the left, then the proton changes it direction. The $F_B$ is always point at the left of the proton, it acts like centripetal forces shows below:
![[qcircles.png]]
We know that the equation of centripetal force is equal to: $$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$ and we substitute the $F_B = F_c$: $$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r} \rightarrow r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

- Example: When a particle pass to a region that contains an electric field, **E**, crossed with a perpendicular magnetic field, **B**. 
![[v=E:B.png]]
The relationship between v, B and E is showed by this equation: $$v = \frac{E}{B}$$ 

### Magnetic Force on wire with current
Let the length of the wire $\ell$ be immersed in magnetic field B with carrying the current $I$, then the force is $$F_B = I\ell \times B$$ With magnitude$$F_B = BI\ell\sin\theta$$
- Example: A U-shaped wire of mass $m$ is lowered into a magnetic field **B** that points out of the plane of the page. How much current $I$ must pass through the wire in order to cause the net force on the wire to be zero?
![[wireoncurrenttogravity.png]]
- Solution: The magnetic force of  $I\ell_1$ is pointing leftward due to the Right-Hand Rule, same reason with $I\ell_3$ but pointing rightward. 
Since the $I\ell_2$ against on the gravity, if we want the net force to be zero, the magnetic force is equal to the force, so$$F_B=F_g \rightarrow I\ell_2B=mg\rightarrow I=\frac{mg}{\ell_2B}$$

### Magnetic Field is created by current-carrying wires
正所谓电磁不分家, there is a deep connection between magnetic and electricity. When the long, straight wire carry with current $I$. The magnetic field is generated by current in surrounding , of magnitude $$B=\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I}{r}$$Which the direction can also use the Right-Hand Rule
![[righthandcurrent.png]](Top of the page of the magnetic field direction is out of the page, and bottom of the magnetic field direction is into the pages)
- Example: When two parallel lines with same current direction. Let their distance be $r$:
![[twoparallellines.png]]
To find the force on Wire 2, consider the magnetic field generated by Wire 1 into the page, plus the $v$ is point rightward, the force is point upward:
![[forceontwoparallelline.png]]
Due to the magnetic field generated by Wire 1, we can find the force per unit length felt by Wire 2 $$F_{B2} = I_2\ell_2B_1 = I_2\ell_2\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I_1}{r} \to \frac{F_{B2}}{\ell}=\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I_1I_2}{r}$$
