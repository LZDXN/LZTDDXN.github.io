#### Electromagnetic waves

The EM waves has obey the classic wave equation $$c=\lambda f$$Also their angular frequency($\omega$) and period ($T$) has two additional ways to express as below: $$\omega=2\pi f$$and $$f=1/T$$

**The electromagnetic Spectrum**
Some waves can be seen by human eyes, which are visible light, other types of waves include *radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays* and *$\gamma$-rays (gamma rays)*.

#### Reflection and Refraction
**Reflection** is the ability of light to seemingly bound off a surface. There are two kinds of reflections: **secular** and **diffuse**. 
![[Types-of-reflection_Science_Learning_Hub.jpg| 500 ]]
In figure above the **Law of Reflection**, the angle of incident equals to the angel of reflected.
If light of a single wavelength can be isolated, the light is said to be **monochromatic**(单色的). If all of the waves of light are moving in phase, the light is said to be **coherent**.

**Refraction** happens when light go through the medium, the light pass different speed in different mediums. 
![[Refraction-Of-Light-Law-Of-Refraction-2.png| 500 ]]
When light travels through empty space, its speed is $c=3.00\times 10^8m/s$. When light travels through a material medium, it's constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by the atoms that compose the material. The reciprocal of this fraction, $$n=\frac{c}{v}$$Which the $n$ is the absolute index of refraction.

The equation that relates $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ involves the index of refraction of the incident medium ($n_1$) and the indexn of refraction of the refracting medium ($n_2$); it's called **Snell's Law**. $$n_1\sin{\theta_1}=n_2\sin{\theta_2}$$If $n_2 > n_1$, then Snell's Law tells us that $\theta_2 < \theta_1$,  which the beam will *toward* the normal as it enters the medium. On the other hand, if $n_2 <n_1$, then $\theta_2 > \theta_1$, the beam will bend *away* from normal.
The light's wavelength is what changes (to a new $\lambda_N$) to accommodate the new velocity and to keep the wave equation true: $$\lambda_Nf=v$$ and $$\lambda_N=\lambda/N$$where $\lambda$ is the wavelength in a vacuum.

**Absolute Indices of Refraction of Selected Media**

Substance | Index of Refraction
--- | ---
Air(vacuum) | 1.00
Water|1.33
Alcohol|1.36
Quartz|1.46
Glass:|
	Crown|1.52
	Flint|1.61
Diamond|2.42

**Dispersion of LIght**
A piece of glass may have the following indices for visible light. ![[dispersion of light.png| 500 ]]

#### Total Internal Reflection
When a beam of light strikes the boundary to a medium that has a lower index of refraction, the beam bends away from the normal. As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of re fraction becomes larger. At some point, when the angle of incidence reaches a **critical angle** $\theta_c$, the angle of refraction becomes 90˚, which means the refracted beams is directed along the surface.
![[total internal reflection.png| 500 ]] For angles of incidence that are greater than $\theta_c$, there is *no* angle of refraction; the entire beam is reflected back into the orginal medium. This phenomenon is called **total internal reflection** (**TIR**). 
TIR occurs when $n_1>n_2$ and $\theta_1>\theta_2$, where $\theta_c=\sin^{-1}(n_2/n_1)$

**Interference and Diffraction of Light**
When two wave of light can cancel each other (**destructive interference**), also can multiple each other and become stronger (**constructive interference**). The equation of those interference are: **Constructive interference:**$$\Delta\ell=m\lambda$$**Destructive interference:**$$\Delta\ell=(m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$$Where $m$=0,1,2...
We have the **Double-Slit Interference Experiment:** ![[double slit.png| 500 ]]
And in order to understand the equation, we used the figure below:![[double slit figure.png| 500 ]]
Because $S_2Q=d\sin\theta$, we have $\Delta\ell = d \sin\theta$. Using those constructive or destructive interference depends on $\Delta\ell$, we can write:
Constructive interference: $$d\sin\theta=m\lambda$$
Destructive interference: $$d\sin\theta=(m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$$(Where m=0,1,2...)
Since $\theta$ is too small, so we the $\tan\theta \approx\sin\theta$. The $x=L\tan\theta$ can be written nearly as $x=L\sin\theta$, plus $\sin\theta=m\lambda/d$, we have$$x_m=\frac{m\lambda L}{d}$$
- The intensity of line increases as the $m$ decreases, so the brighter fringe directly opposite to the midpoint of slit where $m=0$
