### Systems and Fundamental Forces
****Fundamental****
Atoms, the smallest and most basic units of matter and the defining structure of elements. Some general information about atoms:
- Atoms are stable and electrically neutral
- Atoms have chemical properties that allow them to combine with other atoms.
- Atoms emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation with discrete energy and momentum
- Atoms are made up of three particles: ***protons, neutrons,*** and ***electrons.***

Electron | Proton | Neutron
---|---|---
$e^-$|$p$|$n$
$9.11\times10^{-31}kg$|$1.673\times10^{-27}kg$|$1.675\times10^{-25}kg$
$-1.6\times10^{-19}$|$1.6\times10^{19}$|No  charge

**Neutrons** and **Protons** are composed of quarks, which have electric charges that are fractions of the elementary charge of the electron

There are 6types of quarks: up,down, strange, charm, bottom, and top
- up, charm and top have a fractional charge of $+\frac{2}{3}$
- down, strange and bottom have a fractional charge of $-\frac{1}{3}$
- If the total charge is +1, it is proton (e.g. 2U+1D)
- If the total charge is 0, it is neutron (e.g. 1U+2D)

**About atoms symbol:**

**Rutherford's Model**
![[model-Diagram-Rutherford-atom-nucleus-space-electrons.jpg]]
Rutherford's experiment consisted of aiming alpha particles at a thing sheet of gold foil.
![[gold-scattering-experiment.diagram.png]]
Rutherford found that while most of the alpha particles weren't deflected and some were strongly deflected in hyperbolic paths. 
He concluded that atom consisted of mostly empty space, the nucleus was a very small, densely packed, positive charge, and the electrons orbited around the nucleus like planets orbiting the Sun.
However, his proposition had several major problems:
- It didn't account for the appearance of discrete emission line spectra
- The electrons continuously orbiting the nucleus shoudn've produced a continuous band of electromagnetic radiation
- The predicted orbital loss of energy should've caused the electron to crash into the nucleus, disintegrating it, but that doesn't happen

**Bohr Model**
![[bohr model.jpg]]
- Electrons don't emit electromagnetic radiation while in a given orbit
- An electron an only have a certain set orbits.
- An atom has definite energy levels analogous to standing waves.

If the electron absorbs a certain amount of energy, it gets **excited** to a higher orbit with a greater radius. After sometime, it returns to a lower orbit, emitting a photon while doing so. 
When the excited electron drops from energy level $n=jn=j$ to a lower one, $n=in=i$, the energy of the photon emitted is the difference between the two energy levels:$$E_{emitted\space photon}=|\Delta E|=E_j-E_i$$The wavelength of this photon is:$$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{c}{\frac{E_{photon}}{h}}=\frac{hc}{E_j-E_i}$$where 
- c = speed of light = $3.00\times10^8$
- h = Planck's constant = $6.63\times10^{-34} J*s$

### Radioactive Decay
Matter can't be created nor destroyed, but matter can undergo changes in form. Natural radioactive decay is one example of a nuclear reaction that showcases this, other examples include **nuclear fission** and **nuclear fusion**. In all cases of nuclear reactions, nucleon number and charge must be conserved.

**Radioactive** isotopes go through a spontaneous breakdown of an unstable atomic nucleus with the emission of particles and rays. Without the correct arrangement of neutrons and protons, the nucleus can't support itself. Pieces of the nucleus break off, changing the material.

The **half-life** is the time for half of a radioactive sample to decay. The decaying nuclide is known as the ==**parent**==, and the resulting nuclide is known as the ==**daughter**==

**Alpha Decay**
When alpha decay occurs, an alpha particle is emitted. An alpha particle can be represented by:$$^4_2He\space or\space^4_2\alpha$$
**Beta Decay**
There are 3 subcategories of beta decay: $\beta^-$, $\beta^+$ and electron capture($EC$).
- $\beta^-$ **Decay**
$\beta^-$ decay happens when neutron turns into a proton and releases an electron(the ==beta particle==), because neutron-to-proton ratio is too large. The neutron transforming into a proton and an $e^-$ (and a particle called the **electron-antineutrino, $\bar{v}_e$**) is caused by the action of the **weak nuclear force**. A common example of nuclide that undergoes $\beta^-$ decay that undergoes $\beta^-$ is carbon-14, which is used to date archaeological artifacts. $$^{14}_{6}C \rightarrow ^{14}_{7}N + e^-+\bar{v}_e$$ The reaction is balanced, because 14=14+0 and 6=7+(-1).

-  $\beta^+$ **Decay**

When the neutron-to-proton ratio is too small, the nucleus will undergo $\beta^+$ decay. In this form of beta decay, a proton is transformed into a neutron and a **positron**, $^0_{+1}e$ (the electron's **antiparticle**), plus antoher particle, the **electron-neutrino** $v_e$, which are then both ejected from the nucleus. An exaple of a positron emitter is fluorine-17. $$^{16}_9F \rightarrow ^{17}_8O +e^++v_e$$
-  **Electron Capture**
Another way in which a nucleus can increase its neutron-to-proton ratio is to capture an orbiting electron and then cause the transformations of a proton into a neutron. For example Beryllium-7$$^7_4Be +e^- \rightarrow ^7_3Li + v_e$$
-  **Gamma Decay**
Compared to the processes above, the Gamma Decay does not alter the identity of the nucleus. It just allows the nucleus to relax and shed energy. For example when a potassium-42 undergoes $\beta^-$ decay to form calcium-42 $$^{42}_{19}K \rightarrow ^{42}_{20}Ca^*+e^-+\bar{v}_e$$ This asterisk indicates that the daughter Ca nucleus is left in a high-energy, excited state. For this excited nucleus to drop to its ground state, it must emit a photon of energy, a **gamma ray**, symbolized by $\gamma$. $$^{42}_{20}Ca^* \rightarrow ^{42}_{20}Ca + \gamma$$

### Energy in Modern Physics
**Binding Energy**
Since the masses of particles are too small, so we need to use a much smaller mass unit. The **atomic mass unit** (==amu== or ==u==) which use the most abundant isotope of carbon (carbon-12) as a reference. **u** is defined as 1/12 the mass of a $^{12}C$ atom. In terms of amu: $$m_p=1.00728 \space u$$$$m_n=1.00867 \space u$$


### Mass-Energy Equivalence
**Deuteron and the relationship between mass and energy**
The mass of a deuteron is 2.01356 u (symbolized **d**),  which is a little less than the sum of the individual masses of the proton and neutron. The **mass defect** is $$\Delta m=(m_p+m_n)-m_d$$

Einstein says in 1905: $$E=mc^2$$which tells us the relationship between the mass and energy by using the speed of light constant. Because of this, the mass-difference gives us the amount of energy needed to break the deuteron into a spearate proton and neutron. Since this tells us how strongly the nucleus is bound, it is called the **binding energy** of the nucleus. $$E_B=(\Delta m)c^2$$ oh and by the way also, $$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

### Wave-Particles Duality
Light behaves as if its energy were granular, composed of particles, also as wave-like characteristics.
**de Broglie wavelength**:$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$$
- $p$ (linear momentum)



### Photoelectric Effect
A quantum of electromagnetic energy is known as a photo. Light behaves like a stream of photons which is illustrated by the **photoelectric effect**.
- Photoelectrons were ejected within just a few billionths of a second after illumination
- The increasing the intensity of the light did not cause photoelectrons to leave the metal surface with greater kinetic energy, there was a maximum photoelectron kinetic energy.
- More electrons were ejected as the intensity was increased.
- For each metal, there was a certain **threshold frequency** $f_0$: If light of frquency lower than $f_0$ no photoelectron were ejected.

Einstein explained those observations by borrowing from Planck's idea that light came in individual quanta of energy. He called the quanta photons. The energy of a photo is proportional to the frequency of the wave: $$E=hf$$$h$ is **Planck's constant** (about $6.63\times 10^{-34}\space J\cdot s$), $f$ is frequency.
The certain amount of energy had to be imparted to an electron on the metal surface in order to liberate it, this was known as the metal's **work function**, or $\phi$. It an $e^-$ absorbed a photon whose energy $E$ was greater than $\phi$, it would leave the metal with a maximum kinetic energy equal to $E-\phi$, which can be expressed as $$K_{max}=hf-\phi$$Also the *threshold frequency* is $$f_0=\frac{\phi}{h}$$ We use **electronvolt** (eV) as the unit of energy change by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of one volt. Using the equation $\Delta U_E=qV$, we have$$1\space eV=(1e)(1V)=(1.6\times 19^{-19} C)( 1V)=1.6\times 10^{-19}J$$ In terms of electronvolts the value of Plack's constant is $4.14\times 10^{-15} eV\cdot s$
