### Current and Electricity
When two point have the potential difference, the electric charges start moving. The process is called current. Algebraically, we calculate current with the letter $I$ as $$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

### Resistance
In Real world physics, there is nearly no material is superconductor in room temperature. So every material has its different resistivity. While we can measure the Voltage and Current, the resistance is the slope of graph $V/I$ . Which is Ohm's law: $$R=\frac{\Delta V}{I} $$ or $$V=IR$$The unit of resistance is $\Omega$, $1\Omega = 1V/A$, we usually write $\Delta V$ as $V$
