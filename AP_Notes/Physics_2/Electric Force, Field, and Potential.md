### Coulomb's Law
It calculates the Force between two static, charged objects $$F = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$$looks like the law of gravity$$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$While the $k$ here is a constant, it has the value $8.9875\times 10^9 \approx 9\times 10^9 N\cdot m^2/C^2$
Also $k$ can also be expressed as $\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$, so coulomb's law can be written:$$F = (\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon })\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$

### The Electric Field
The electric field is denoted by $\vec{E}$, we put a test charge to calculate the electric field from the test charge. From a test point charge force $F_{on\space q}$ we have $$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_{on\space q}}{q}$$
From $F_{on\space q}=k\frac{Q\times q}{r^2}$, we have $$E = k\frac{Q}{r^2}$$The unit of Electric Field is $N/C$ also $V/m$

#### Electric Field superposition
$$E_{total}=\sum E_n$$

### Electric potential energy
The energy stored by the movement of charged object in electric field is the electric potential, same principle with Physics 1, the connection between potential  $U$ and work $W$ is $$\Delta U_E = - W_E$$
For example, there is a Electric Field toward right, we have a $q$ with positive charge move from left to right $r$ distance. Since we only look on uniform charge distribution  electric field, so $F_E = qE$. The work done be the electric field is : $W_E=rF_E=rqE$, so the change of electric potential is : $$\Delta U=-rqE$$On the other hand, if we have another experiment but with negative charge, the work is $W_E=-rqE$ and the change of potential is $$\Delta U=rqE$$

### Electric potential
==*Electric Potential Energy*== is different from the ==*Electric Potential*==. Electric potential is measuring the potential difference or voltage. For a charge $q$, we assume if the $q$'s distance is infinity from the Electric Field , the potential is 0. Also, voltage is the unit of electric field potential, which $$V=\frac{U_E}{q}$$
From $E = k\frac{Q}{r^2}$ plus $\Delta U=rqE$, we have $$V=k\frac{Q}{r}$$The unit of V is $J/C$ also $N\cdot m/C$
The work done when a $+q$ move from positive $+Q$ to $-Q$ is $$W=q\Delta V$$and $$\Delta V=-Ed$$

### Capacitance
When there are two charge parallel metal plates in a configuration called capacitor. Capacitance have capability to store charge, unit is farad ($F$). It is define to be the ratio of the charge on either conductor and the potential difference between the conductors.$$C=\frac{Q}{V}$$
