### Demand
A market **demand** shows the quantity of a product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each and every price.

#### Law of Demand
The reason why Demand curve sloping down:
- The higher price, the less quantity consumers want to buy
- The lower price, the larger quantity consumers want  to buy

**Reasons for the Law of Demand**
1. **The income effect**: When prices $\downarrow$, consumers can afford to buy more. When prices $\uparrow$ the price-to-wage ratio increase, so consumer are less affordable to those goods and services.Â´
2. **The Substitution Effect**: Assume $A$ and $B$ can substitute each other. 
	- $P_A \uparrow so\space Q_A \downarrow$, which leads to $Q_B \uparrow$
	- $P_A \downarrow so\space Q_A \uparrow$, which leads to $Q_B \downarrow$
3. **Diminishing Marginal Utility**: The more units of the same product are consumed, the less marginal utility consumer has, which may led the result of total utility from increase to decrease and the less price they are willing to pay.

#### Change in Quantity Demanded vs. Shift in Demand
If question ask the effect of changing price(focus on one product), the answer *should* be a *movement* on demand curve:

If there is something else from the prices lead to the change of demand, it will causing the *shift of demand*.

There are several ***determinants of demand***, which are the ***shifts in Demand***. We have a useful hint for remembering those contents:
>SPICE
- $S$ -- Substitute goods
- $P^2$ -- Preferences or Population
- $I$ -- Income
- $C$ -- Complementary goods
- $E$ -- Expectations

**Substitution Effect**
Assume A and B are substitution goods. The $\uparrow P_A$ cause the $\downarrow Q_A$ which is a ==* movement on graph*==:

and  $Q_B \uparrow$ is a ==*shift on graph*==:

**Complementary goods**
Assume A and B are complementary goods, $P_A \downarrow$ causing $Q_B \uparrow$.


### Supply
A market's **supply** shows the quantity of a product a producer is willing and able to produce.

#### Law of Supply
The price of a product increases, the larger quantity producers are willing to produce, similar reason to Demand Curve. (We all love money)

#### Shifts of Supply
The most essential reason to supply are easy to understand:
- Input: Materials of producing, human capitals, tax etc.
- Technology
- Expectations of Inflation


### Market Equilibrium
Where the demand and supply curves meet together.

When market is in equilibrium shift happens, there will be surplus or shortage:

**==Surplus==** also happens when an effective **==price floor==** applies
**==Shortage==** also happens when an effective **==price ceiling==** applies


Summary
---
- No change in Supply:
	-  Demand $\rightarrow$ shift, Price $\uparrow$ and Q $\uparrow$
	-  Demand $\leftarrow$ shift, Price $\downarrow$ and Q $\downarrow$
- No change in Demand:
	-  Supply $\rightarrow$ shift, Price $\downarrow$ and Q $\uparrow$
	-  Supply $\leftarrow$ shift, Price $\uparrow$ and Q $\downarrow$
- Double Shifts:
	-  Demand $\rightarrow$ 
		-  Supply $\rightarrow$ , Price *Indeterminate* and Q $\uparrow$
		-  Supply $\leftarrow$ , Price  $\uparrow$ and Q *indeterminate*
	-  Demand $\leftarrow$ 
		-  Supply $\leftarrow$ , Price *Indeterminate* and Q $\downarrow$
		-  Supply $\rightarrow$ , Price $\downarrow$ and Q *indeterminate*
