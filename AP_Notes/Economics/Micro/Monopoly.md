They produce the goods where **MC = MR**, but the price is set on demand at that quantity.

#### Price Discrimination
Different consumer has different price willing to pay, so here comes the discrimination. If a monopoly company have **perfect price discrimination**, it collect each consumer's highest prices are willing to pay. Here is the graph:![[f0176-01.jpg|500]]
When there is a **perfect price discrimination**, the total revenue will be the area of triangle CBE. In addition, it will be **Allocative efficiency** here.

## Natural Monopoly
Sometimes, the cost is minimized when there is only one firm produce. This situation is called **natural monopoly**. The government won't allow thsoe company receive that much money from consumers since the inelasticity of some product(for example, water supply or electric supply), so there are some regulation:
1. **Socially optimal pricing**: Government regulators will force the monopoly to have allocatively efficient pricing at P = MC
2. **Fair-Return pricing**: Regulators set the P = ATC to make the monopoly break even
3. **Unregulated monopoly**: Where MC=MR
