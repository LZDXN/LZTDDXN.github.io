#### Elasticity
**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: Measures the responsiveness of Quantity demand given a price change
$$PED=\frac{\Delta Qd}{\Delta P}=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{Q_1}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{P_1}}$$Midpoint method（中点法）:$$PED=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{\frac{Q_1+Q_2}{2}}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}}}$$
The Elasticity Coefficient Value

- If demand for a good is *==elastic==*, an increase in price change leads the change of quantity *larger than proportional*
- If demand for a good is *==inelastic==*, an increase in price change leads the change of quantity *smaller than proportional*
- If demand for a good is *==unit elastic==*, an increase in price changes leads the change of quantity *proportionally*.


Type of Elasticity | Elasticity Value
---|---
Perfectly Inelastic|PED = 0
Relatively Inelastic|PED < 1
Unit Elastic|PED = 1
Relatively Elastic|PED > 1
Perfectly Elastic|PED = $\infty$

**Determine Demand Elasticity**
- Number of **Substitutes** available
	- If there is close substitution goods: PED > 1
	- If not: PED < 1
- **Necessity**
	- If good is necessity: PED < 1
	- If not: PED > 1
- **Addiction**: Similar to **necessity**, for example tobacco, coffee........
- **Delay**
	- If the product can be purchased later: PED > 1
	- If the product have to be purchased in a short time: PED < 1
- **Percentage of income**
	- Large proportion to income: PED > 1
	- Smaller proportion to income: PED < 1


**Elasticity Zones**
The demand curve itself has its own elasticity zones, because the percentage change from **upper edge** of the demand curve has a ==higher responsiveness== to price change than **lower edge of the demand curve.**

**Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)**
The way to calculate is also change in quantity divided by change in price $$PES=\frac{\Delta Q_s}{\Delta P}$$
**Determine Supply Elasticity**
- **The availability of Inputs**
	- Less input available: PES > 1
	- More input available: PES < 1
- **Time**
	- More time: PES > 1
	- Less time: PES < 1

**Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand**
The **cross-price elasticity of demand** measures the effect of the change in one good's price on the other good's quantity demand. Which equals:$$CPED=\frac{\Delta Q_A}{\Delta P_B}$$
- Goods are **substitutes** when CPED is *positive*
- Goods are **complements** when CPED is *negative*

**Income Elasticity of Demand**
$$\frac{\Delta Quantity}{\Delta Income}$$
- When the IED is *positive*, the good is a *normal good*. (Income $\uparrow$ Qd $\uparrow$)
- When the IED is *negative*, the good is an *inferior good*. (Income $\uparrow$ Qd $\downarrow$)

#### Tax
Once government put tax on product, the supply curve will shift left, but since the elasticity of demand and supply, producer have to decide who will pay more tax.

Elasticities|Tax Incidence
---|---
PED > PES|Producers pay more tax
PED < PES|Consumers pay more tax
Perfectly Inelastic PED|Consumers pay all tax
Perfectly Inelastic PES|Producers pay all tax
Perfectly Elastic PED|Producers pay all tax
Perfectly Elastic PES|Consumers pay all tax

#### Trade, Tariffs and Quota
We havn't discussed this yet in our class, but in Macro-economics there is a unit called [[International Trade and Finance]]. When there is no tariffs nor quotas in a country, the price of the product is world price.

Though Tariff causes Dead Weight Loss, it is a protection to domestic products.

#### Consumer choice theory
When consumers buy goods, they get utility from it. The more good consumer buy, the less marginal utility the consumer gain and it will eventually become negative. This is called **diminishing marginal utility**.
**The utility-maximization rule**
This rule is used when consumers have limit money but want maximize total utility. We use this formula: $$\frac{MU_X}{P_X}=\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$$Using the Utility-Maximization Rule, we can anlysis this result as:

situation|action
---|---
If $\frac{MU_X}{P_X}>\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$|Buy more X and less Y
If $\frac{MU_X}{P_X}<\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$|Buy more Y and less X
If $\frac{MU_X}{P_X}=\frac{MU_Y}{P_Y}$|Maintain current consumption level
