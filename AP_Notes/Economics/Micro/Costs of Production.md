**The long run and short run**:
- **Long run**: When all resources used in production are variable and supply can adjust to changes in demand. 
- **Short run**: Where at least one production input is fixed and supply cannot fully adjust to changes in demand.

**Law of diminishing marginal returns**
A firm adds an increasing amount of variable resources (labor) to a fixed resource, the additional production each new worker adds will eventually decrease. So the marginal cost will finally increase where it is upward sloping.

#### Total and Average costs
- **Total Fixed cost (TFC)**: Fixed cost in production
	- **Average Fixed cost (AFC)**: TFC divided by output, it decreases as output increases.
- **Total Variable costs (TVC)**: The sum of in each good except for the fixed cost.
	- **Average Variable cost (AVC)**: TVC/output, but since the law of diminishing marginal returns, the AVC curve is U-shape
	- ==When firms produce below the AVC curve, they should **shut down**==
- **Total Cost**: Equals TFC+TVC
	- **Average Total cost (ATC)**: Total cost divided by production
		- When ATC curve is downward sloping, there are increasing return s to scale which is called ==***Economics of Scale***==. The output is larger than proportional with input.
		- When the ATC is at the lowest point, it is called ==***constant returns to scale***==, where inputs and outputs are proportional.
		- When ATC curve is upward sloping, there is a decreasing returns to the scale, which is called ==***Diseconomies of scale***==

>The lowest point of ATC and AVC is on MC

#### Profits and Costs
An **explicit cost** is a cost that involves actually using or paying money
An **implicit cost** does not require payment of money, but simply a measure of the value of benefits that are forgone (opportunity cost)

**Accounting profit & Economic profit**
- **Accounting Profit** = Total Revenue - explicit costs
- **Economic Profit** = Total Revenue - explicit costs - implicit costs

**Normal Profit Rules**
A **positive economic profit** indicates that the current use is the best use of resources
A **negative economic profit** indicates that there is a better alternative use for resources
A zero economic profit is called a **normal profit**
