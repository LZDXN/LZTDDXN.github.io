**Market failure** occurs when resources are not allocated optimally, where allocatively efficiency is not achieved, which can result from
- Imperfect competition
- Externalities
- Public goods
- Imperfect information

The market has created a **failure** if any *Externalities* exists.
**Externalities** are costs or benefits felt beyond or "external to" those causing the effects. 
- Negative Externality, one that is negative to society ($MSC>MPC$)
- Positive Externality, one that is positive for society ($MSB>MPB$)
- Social Optimal Level is where $MSB=MSC$ with no other curves


**Private vs. Social Benefits**
The **marginal social benefit of a good or activity** is equal to the marginal benefit that accrues to consumers plus its marginal external benefit.
- MPB = Marginal Private Benefit (the benefit to paying consumers)
- MSB = Marginal Social Benefit (the benefit to society)
- MEB = Marginal External Benefit (an increase in additional benefit to society from an additional unit of the good)
$$MSB=MPB+MEB$$
- **To solve a positive externality, apply a per-unit subsidy until MPB=MSB**

**Private vs. Social Costs**
The **marginal social cost of a good or activity** is equal to the marginal cost of production plus its marginal external cost.
- MPC = Marginal Private Cost (the cost to producing the good)
- MSC = Marginal Social Cost (the cost for society)
- MEC = Marginal External Cost (the increase in cost to society from an additional unit of the good)
$$MSC=MPC+MEC$$
- **To solve a negative externality, apply a per-unit tax until MPC=MSC**


#### Private vs. Public Goods
There are two categories for goods:
- **Excludable** (排他性)
	- A good is excludable if the supplier of that good can prevent people who do not pay from consuming it.
	- When a good is nonexcludable, the supplier cannot prevent consumption by people who do not pay for it.
- **Rival** (竞争性)
	- A good is rival in comsumption if the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time.
	- A good is nonrival in consumption if more than one person can consume the same unit of the good at the same time.

##### Characteristics of Goods

|                | Rival in Consumption | Nonrival in consumption       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Excludeable    | **Private goods**    | **Artificially scarce goods** |
| Non-Excludable | **Common resources** | **Public goods**              | 


**The Free-Rider Problem**
- Goods that are **nonexcludable** suffer from a **free-rider problem**.
- In this case, individuals have no incentive to pay for their own consumption and instead will take a "free ride" from anyone who does pay.

**Nonrival Efficiency**
- When goods are **nonrival in consumption**, the efficient price for consumption is zero.
- If a positive price is charged to compensate producers for the cost of production, the result is inefficiently low consumption.

### Lorenz curve (Distribution of income)
To measure the income equality, there is a curve called **Lorenz curve**, which also associated with Gini Coefficient. 
![[Prin_9781524710408_epub3_114_r1.jpg|500]]
The Gini Coefficient is the ratio $$\frac{shaded\space area}{area\space of\space triangle\space ABC}$$
- If perfect equality distribute of income, the coefficient is 0
- If the richest family made all income, the coefficient is 1

####  Poverty and Taxes
- Poverty Line: Official benchmark of poverty
- The **Social Security** program provides cash benefits and health insurance (Medicare) to retired and disabled workers and their families.
- **Public assistance** or **welfare** (福利) typically provides temporary assistance to the very poor.
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)** (养老金) assists very poor elderly individuals who have virtually no assets and little or no Social Security entitlement.
- **Unemployment compensation** (失业补贴) provides temporary assistance to unemployed workers.
- **Medicaid** (医疗救助制度) provides health and hospitalization benefits to the poor.
- The **Food Stamp** and **Public Housing** (庇护所) programs provide food and shelter for the poor.


- **Progressive tax**: 
	- Government receives larger percentage of revenue from families with larger incomes
	- Make the distribution more equality
- **Regressive tax**: 
	- Government receives larger percentage of revenue from families with smaller incomes
	- Make the distribution more inequality
- **Proportional tax**:
	- Government receives same percentage of come from all families
	- No change to the equality/inequality
