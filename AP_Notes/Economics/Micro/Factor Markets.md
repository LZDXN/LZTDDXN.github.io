The last worker hired is depend on marginal revenue product the worker produce.

#### Monopsony
A **monopsony** is a single buyer of labor, it has not two downward- but two upward-sloping curves, S and MFC. The MFC curve increases at a faster rate than the supply curve  as a monopsony cannot wage discriminate. As it hire additional workers, it must pay higher wages to them as well as to every other worker previously hired.

**Least Cost Rule**
To minimize costs, a firm will adjust the ratio of input of workers and capitals by $$\frac{MP_L}{P_L}=\frac{MP_K}{P_K}$$ Where K stands for capital.
