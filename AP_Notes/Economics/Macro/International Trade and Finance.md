#### The Balance of Trade
>Balance of trade = Exports - Imports
- *Trade deficit*: When Balance of Trade is *negative*
- *Trade surplus*: When Balance of Trade is *positive*

**Quota** 定额
>The number of goods government allows to import

![[f0385-01.jpg|500]]
- If quota=0, $P=P_3$
- The increase of quota, the closer to world price (usually decrease, $P_2$)
- No Quota means the price =  world price ($P_1$)

**Tariff** 关税
>Tax for imports in order to decrease number of import goods

![[f0385-02.jpg|500]]
- Similar Principle to Quota
- The higher tariff, the closer to $P_3$ (Domestic producer protections)
- The lower tariff, the closer to $P_1$ (Free trading Price)
- No Tariff means the price = world price ($P_1$)

#### Exchange Rates

- When foreigners want more native products:
	- Supply from foreign money increase (*foreign*  supply curve $\rightarrow ,er\downarrow$ to that foreign country,depreciates)
	- Demand to native product increase (*native* demand curve $\rightarrow ,er\uparrow$ to native country, appreciates)
- When native people want more foreigners' products:
	- Supply from native money increase (*native* supply curve $\rightarrow,er\downarrow$,depreciates)
	- Demand to foreign country increase (*foreign* demand curve $\rightarrow,er\uparrow$,appreciates)

||Value|Net Export ($E_{net}$)|Current account|Financial account|
---|---|---|---|---
A Country|Appreciates|Negative|Deficit|Surplus
B Country|Depreciates|Positive|Surplus|Deficit
