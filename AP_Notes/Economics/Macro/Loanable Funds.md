#### What is a "Loanable Funds" market?
A market that tries to determine an equilibrium between those that lend money & those that want to borrow money.
#### Demand for Loanable Funds
![[loanable demand.jpeg|500]]
	At ***high*** interest rates, the quantity demanded for loans ***decreases***.
	At ***low*** interest rates, the quantity demanded for loans ***increases***.

**Shifts of Demand**
- Change in business opportunities
If you think something is more profitable, you will want to put more money into something.
- Change in government borrowing
If Government needs to borrow money, they demand more loans.

#### Supply of Loanable Funds
![[loanable supply.jpeg|500]]
At *high* interest rates, the quantity supplied for loans *increase*.
At *low* interest rates, the quantity supplied for loans *decrease*.

**Shifts of supply**
- Change in Saving
	- If $\uparrow$ Consumption, then savings $\downarrow$ and loans $\downarrow$
	- If $\downarrow$ Consumption, then savings $\uparrow$ and loans $\uparrow$
- Change in Capital inflows
	- ***More*** investment from other countries, ***More*** supply of Loanable funds (Right Shift)
	- ***Less*** investment from other countries, ***Less*** supply of Loanable funds (Left Shift)
- Change in Money Supply
#### Crowding Out Effect
When a government needs to borrow money (because it didn't receive enough in taxes to cover its expenses). Then, there is a decrease in investment because of this higher interest rate.

This shift of Demand comes from the government but causes high interest rates, thus discourages borrowing and spending, especially for investment. ==The *decrease* in investment spending by businesses can **offset** the government's expansionary fiscal policy.==

#### Connection between Loan and Inflation
- When a loan is made, a person must pay the loan over a period of time.
- While the bank gives a nominal interest rate, people have to think about the inflation over that period of time.
>The true cost of borrowing comes from Real Interest Rate.
>Real = Nominal - Inflation

#### Interest Rate in the Short-Run

An ***increase*** in the money supply causes an ***increase*** in the supply of Loadable funds.
