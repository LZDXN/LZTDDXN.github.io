#### Business Cycles
![[f0325-01.jpg|500]]
- **Peak**: The relative maximum point
- **Contraction**: The downward sloping curve
- **Trough**: The relative minimum point
- **Expansion**: The upward sloping curve

#### Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)
![[f0326-01.jpg|500]]
This curve also represents the potential output of an country. LRAS *never* shifts in short run, the increase of LRAS shows the economic growth of a country.

#### Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)
![[f0328-01.jpg|500]]
Aggregate Supply means the collection of all supplies from all producers. The determines of **shift** in SRAS are similar to what  [[Demand and Supply]] have discussed:
- Change in Input price: (Worker's wages, material costs)
- Improvements of Technology: (Causing the production more efficiency)
- Expectations of Inflation: Producers use past experience to expect the future prices and make decisions.

#### Aggregate Demand
Aggregate Demand is the amount of goods and services demanded by households, businesses, governments and foreigners. It is the demand for all final goods and services by everyone.

![[f0331-01.jpg|500]]
Economists identify three primary effects that cause this relationship.
- **The Foreign Trade Effect**: We will talk about this in [[International Trade and Finance]]
- **The Interest Rate Effect**: When the price level increases, the real quantity of money decreases. People need more money even to continue their current consumption levels
- **The Real Wealth Effect**: When the prices level increases, the value of assets such as cash and checking-account balance falls. 

In market graphs, AD curve are the curve that more likely to **shift** in short-run, the determines of shifts are:
- Changes in Consumption
	- Incomes or wealth effect
- Changes in Investments
	- Interest rates
- Changes in Government Purchases
	- Spending
	- Money Supply
	- Taxes
- Changes in Net Exports
	- Imports
	- Exports

Anyway, we can find that the change of any components of GDP will affect the change in AD.

**Equilibrium of AD and AS**
Well, where the three lines meet together.
![[eqADAS.jpg|500]]
From this equilibrium point, any shift of AD or AS (usually AD) will cause gaps either **==Expansionary Gap==** or **==Recession Gap==**
