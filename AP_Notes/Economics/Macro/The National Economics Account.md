#### Limitation of current models (GDP)
- GDP only measures variable (actual data), not anything normative
- Spending money in the hospital adds to GDP
- Personal favor doesn't affect GDP
- Taking off time from work to volunteer does not add to GDP

#### Limitation of inflation (CPI)
- Substitute bias - if prices $\uparrow$, usually, consumers buy less of the product and buy its substitutes.
- New Products - the CPI market basket does not always include the newest consumer products
- Product Quality - the CPI ignores improvement and decline in product quality since it only care about price
