Control Group
---
- Control groups are the groups in experiment with no treatment that to compare with the experiment group.
- In this experiment, control group is the group with no caffeine.
- While dividing the group, one group of students are given the coffee-favor drink with no caffeine in it, this group is observed to compare with the group drinks with caffeine. From this observation, Mr. Hou can look and see the difference between the cause (caffeine) and the one with no treatment.

Independent variable (IV)
---
- Independent variables are variable that is manipulated by researchers, these are corresponding to the "cause" in cause & effect.
- In this experiment, the independent variable is the caffeine or not, it is used to test if the caffeine affects the academic performance with the dependent variable (DV).
- In the experiment, one independent variable is the group of student who drink with caffeine, and the other independent variable is the group of student who drink without the caffeine. Therefore Mr. Hou can control the "cause" of the experiment.

Random assignment
---
- Random assignment is the a way to divide people in the experiments into control group and experiment group in the most unbiased way.
- In this experiment, the researcher will use random assignment to divide students into two groups by random assign them without any other consideration.
- The researchers will number each single person in the experiment up, then shuffle the numbers by computer then separated them into two groups. No more other possible bias are considered. So this experiments with contain less confounding variables and Mr. Hou can see the cause of caffeine that affects academic performance more accurately.
