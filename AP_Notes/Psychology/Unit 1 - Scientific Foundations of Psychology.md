# Unit 1 - Scientific Foundations of Psychology
#psychology

- **Psychology** ::: The science of behavior and mental processes of people and organisms.  Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychology lab in Leipzig, Germany.
<!--SR:!2021-11-28,43,286-->

# The Scientific Attitude
**Curiosity**
>Sometimes a crazing -sounding ideas find support.

**Skepticism**
>Being skeptical but not cynical, open but not gullible.

**Humility**
>An awareness of our own vulnerability to error and openness to new perspectives.

## Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is a thinking style that examines assumption, appraises the source, discerns hidden biases, evaluates evidence and assess conclusions based on the scientific attitude (curiosity + skepticism + humility).
Critical thinkers will also consider the credibility of sources, they will also look at the evidence, and recognize multiple perspectives. 

### Why is rat always right?
Because rat is used in experiment and the truth is always right?

## SQ3R
>A study method incorporating five steps: Survey, Question, Read, Retrieve, Review

# Psychology Perspectives
- **Behavioral Approach/Perspective** : The scientific study of observable behavior, and its explanation by principles of learning.?
- **Focus**: How we learn observable responses

- **Biological Approach/Perspective** : The scientific study of the links between biological (genetic, neural, hormonal) and psychological processes. (Some biological psychologists call themselves behavioral neuroscientists, neuropyschologists, behavior geneticists, physiological psychologists, or biopsychologists.)
- **Focus**: How the body and brain enable emotions, memories, and sensory experiences; how our genes and our environments influence our individual differences.

## Cognitive Approach/Perspective
>The study of mental processes, such as occur when we perceive, learn, remember, think, communicate, and solve problems.
- **Focus**: How we encode, process, store, and retrieve information

## Evolutionary Approach/Perspective
>The study of the evolution of behavior and the mind, using principles of natural selection
- **Focus**: How the natural selection of traits has promoted the survival of genes

## Humanistic Approach/Perspective
- **Focus**: How we achieve personal growth and self-fulfillment

## Psychodynamic Approach/Perspective
>A branch of psychology that studies how unconscious drives and conflicts influence behavior and uses that information to treat people with psychological disorders.
- **Focus**: How behavior springs from unconscious drives and conflicts

## Social-Cultural
>The study of how situations and cultures affect our behavior and thinking
- **Focus**: How behavior and thinking vary across situations and cultures

## Biopsycholosocial Approach/Perspective
>An integrated approach that incorporates biological, psychological, adn social-cultural viewpoints

# Approaches in Psychology(Cards)
- **Empiricism** ::: The view that knowledge originates in experience and that science should rely on observation and experimentation.

# Research Methods in Psychology
## Descriptive Methods
- **Descriptive Method** ::: This method organize and summarized data.
<!--SR:!2021-11-28,43,295-->
- **Survey** ::: The questionnaires that attempt to gather data on what people think and have done.
<!--SR:!2021-11-30,45,286-->
- 
|                              Strength                               |                                              Weakness                                              |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|        Surveys can gather large amounts of data very quickly        |                  Participants (that is what we call research volunteers) can lie                   |
|        Surveys can gather large amounts of data very easily         |                            Participants can misunderstand the question                             |
|      The data can be processed easily into information easily       | **Wording Effect**: The questions can be written in a way that affects the participant's responses |
| It is a good way to study sensitive topics and allows for anonymity |                                   Cannot ask follow up question                                    |

- **Case Study** ::: Gather lots of deep data about a specific group rather than gather lots of "surface" data.
- 
|                        Strength                         |                          Weakness                           |
|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| This method can provide a full picture of what happened | Time consuming to gather detailed data from a person's life |
|        Chronological data, when did event happen        |            If it takes time, then it takes money            |
|              Different view of the subject              |                 Often occurs after the fact                 |
|                                                         |                   Can't assume causality                    |
|                                                         |               Might not be ==generalizable==                |


- **Naturalistic Observation** ::: Researchers *go* to peoples' environments and observer them as they really are. (People do not live in lab, when they know they are observed they might not act naturally)
<!--SR:!2021-12-14,59,290-->
- **Observer effect** ::: When human/animals are observed, they may not behave naturally, therefore affects the result.
- **Participation observation** ::: Observing a group by blending in. However, the groups does not know they are being observed.
<!--SR:!2021-11-28,43,295-->

|                                              Strength                                              |                                    Weakness                                     |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                         Naturalistic Observation allows for authentic data                         |                         Ethics of **informed consent**                          |
| People and animals can't react to the observer's presence if they don't know they're being watched | Lack of "control" means the observer doesn't really know what they are watching |
|                                Possibly allows for "real" treatment                                |                Results can only be descriptions not explanations                |

### Cross-Sectional vs. Longitudinal
- **Longitudinal study** ::: Studying a person or event over a long period of time.
<!--SR:!2021-10-26,7,280-->
- **Cross sectional study** ::: A study in wide-range group of people and short time consumed compared to the other one.
<!--SR:!2021-11-27,42,293-->
- **Ex-post facto study** ::: Studying something after it happened naturally. Look at the effect, seek the cause. 
<!--SR:!2021-12-01,46,295-->

| Cross Sectional                                         | Longitudinal                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Compares different groups                               | Follows one group                              |
| Gathers data at one point in time                       | Gathers data over a long time                  |
| Picture or snapshot, doesn't give history or full image | Can data be generalized?                       |
|                                                         | Great for questions of Developments Psychology |

## Experiment
- **Experiment** ::: A research method in which an investigator manipulates one or more factors (independent variables) to observe the effect on some behavior or mental process (the dependent variables); makes it possible to study cause and effect relationships.
<!--SR:!2021-11-30,45,286-->

<!--SR:!2021-12-02,47,295-->
- **Double-blind procedure** ::: An experimental procedure in which both participant and staff are ignorant about the research participants have received the treatment or placebo. There will have the third-party people to maintain the information.
- **Placebo** ::: A pseudo treatment. In drug studies: a pill with no drug in it. 
<!--SR:!2021-11-26,41,291-->
- **Placebo effect** ::: Experimental results caused by expectations. People's mental movement may affect their feeling, behavior etc. and affect the experiments result. 
- **Experimental group** ::: The group which receives the treatments in the experiment.
<!--SR:!2021-12-05,50,279-->

The empirical rule: $\pm 1\sigma:68\%$; $\pm 2\sigma:95\%$; $\pm 3\sigma:99.7\%$
- **Statistical significance** ::: A statistical statement of how likely it is that an obtained result occurred by chance. (Can this sample statistic be generalized to the whole population?)
- **Correlation** ::: A measure of the extent to which two factors vary together, and thus of how well either factor predicts the other. ==Correlation does not show causation==.
- **Correlation coefficient** ::: A statistical index of the relationship between two things (from $-1$ to $+1$)
<!--SR:!2021-12-19,64,311-->
- **Illusory correlation** ::: The perception of a relationship where none exists. (Note:所谓玄学)
<!--SR:!2021-12-03,48,270-->
- **Scatterplot** ::: A graphed cluster of dots each of which represents the values of two variables. The slope of the points suggests the direction of the relationship between the two variables. The amount of scatter suggest the strength of the correlation (little scatter indicates high correlation)
![[Pasted image 20210916204013.png|300]]
- **Positive correlation** ::: When $x$ increases, $y$ increases.
- **Negative correlation** ::: When $x$ increases, $y$ decreases.
