## Neural Communication

![[Pasted image 20210922063151.png]]
- **neuron** ::: A nerve cell; the basic building block of the nervous system. 
- **cell body** ::: The part of a neuron that contains the nucleus; the cell's life-support center.
- **dendrite** ::: The branching extensions that receives and integrate messages from other cells and conducting impulses towards the cell body.
- **axon** ::: The neuron extension that passes messages through its branches through its branches to other neurons or to muscles or glands.
Unlike the short dendrites, axons may be very long. It projects several feet through the body. A human neuron carrying orders to muscle. 
- **myelin sheath** ::: A fatty tissue layer segmentally encasing the axons of some neurons; this enables vastly greater transmission speed as neural impulses hlop from one node to the next. (So practice more passes faster)
- **glial cells** ::: Cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons; they also play a role in learning, thinking, and memory.
<!--SR:!2021-11-17,20,250-->
- **terminal branches of axon** ::: Connections of axon and other cells, passes the message and send to neighboring dendrites.

### Types of neurons
![[Pasted image 20210922064724.png]]

## Neural Impulse
Neurons transmit messages when stimulated by our senses or by neighboring neurons. Like how the computer components send messages, the neurons pass information by firing an impulse, called action potential.
- **action potential** ::: A neural impulse; a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon.
- **resting potential** ::: The period that waits for the axon membrane's electrical charge reaches the threshold.
- **threshold** ::: The level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse. Once the cell reach this zone, an action potential will fire.
- **refractory period** ::: After the neuron is fired, there is a resting pause in which another action potential is not possible.
- **all-or-none response** ::: Boolean message, the neuron is either firing or resting.

## How Neurons Communicate
- **synapse** ::: The junction between sending neuron and the dendrite or cell body of the receiving neuron, neurons are transmitting by chemicals.  There is a tiny gap there is called *synaptic gap* or *synaptic cleft*.
- **neurotransmitters** ::: Chemical messengers that cross the synaptic gaps between neurons. It is released when an action potential reaches the threshold.
- **reuptake** ::: A neurotransmitter's reabsorption by the sending neuron.

## How Drugs and Other Chemicals Alter Neurotransmission
![[Pasted image 20210929074729.png]]
```ad-note
title: Difference between neurotransmitters and drugs
Nerotransmitters are produced inside the body. They can excite and inhibit neural communication.
Drugs and otehr chemicals come from outside the body. They can have agonistic effect or an antagonistic effect on neurotransmissions.
```
![[Pasted image 20211002165701.png]]
- **agonist** ::: molecules that ==increase== a neurotransmitter's action.
<!--SR:!2021-10-27,8,250-->
- **antagonist** ::: molecules that ==decrease== (inhibit or block) a neurotransmitter's action.


## The Nervous System
- **nervous system** ::: The body's speedy, electrochemical communication network, consisting of all the nerve cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems.

![[Pasted image 20211002170059.png]]
- **central nervous system (CNS)** ::: The brain and spinal cord.
- **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** ::: The sensory and motor neurons that connect the central nervous systems(CNS) to the rest of the body.
- **nerves** ::: Bundled axons that form neural cables connecting the central nervous system with muscles, glands, and sense organs. 
- **sensory (afferent) neurons** ::: Neurons that carry incoming information from the body's tissues and sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord. 
- **motor (efferent) neurons** ::: Neurons that carry outgoing information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and glands.
- **interneurons** ::: Neurons within the brain and spinal cord; they communicate internally and process information between the sensory inputs and motor outputs.
<!--SR:!2021-10-25,6,250-->

### The Peripheral Nervous System
- **somatic nervous system** ::: The division of the peripheral nervous system that controls the body's skeletal muscles. Also called the *skeletal nervous system*.
- **autonomic nervous systems(ANS)** ::: The part of the PNS that controls the glands and the muscles of the internal organs (e.g. heart). Its sympathetic division arouses; its parasympathetic division clams. 
- **sympathetic** ::: The division of the autonomic nervous system that arouses the body, mobilizing its energy.
- **parasympathetic division** ::: The division of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body, conserving its energy.

### The Central Nervous System
The brain's neuron creates a network that let people learn, speak, or solve problems. These neurons are fire together and wire together. One part of the CNS, the *spinal cord* is a two-way information highway connection between the peripheral nervous system and the brain. The neural pathways governing the reflexes, our automatic responses to stimuli. 
- **reflex** ::: A simple, automatic response to a sensory stimulus. 

![[Pasted image 20211013092707.png]]
Because the simple pain-reflex pathway runs through the spinal cord and right back out, your hand jerks away from the flame *before* you feel pain(your brain receives and response to the information)

### The Endocrine System
- **endocrine system** ::: The body's "slow" chemical communication system; a set of glands that secrete hormones into the blood steam. 
- **hormones** ::: Chemical messengers that are manufactured by the endocrine glands, travel through.

![[Pasted image 20211013094838.png]]
- **adrenal gland** ::: A pair of endocrine glands that sit just above the kidneys and secrete hormones that help arouse the body in times of stress.
- **pituitary gland** ::: The endocrine system's most influential gland. Under the influence of the hypothalamus, the pituitary regulates growth and controls other endocrine glands.
- **thyroid gland** ::: 

The feedback system: brain $\to$ pituitary $\to$ other glands $\to$ hormones $\to$ body and brain.


## Brain

## The Tools of Discovery

- **lesion** ::: Tissue destruction. A brain lesion is a naturally or experimentally caused destruction of brain tissue.

### Structure of the Brain
- **CT(computed tomography) scan** ::: A series of X-ray photographs taken from different angles and combined by computer into a composite representation of a slice of the brain's structure (aka CAT scan)
- **MRI(magnetic resonance imagine)** ::: A technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce computer-generated images of soft tissue. MRI scans show brain anatomy. 磁共振成像 ![[Pasted image 20211018200500.png]]
	- The person's head is put in a strong magnetic field, which aligns the spinning atoms of brain molecules. Then a radio-wave pulse momentarily disorients the atoms. When those atoms return to their normal spin, they emit signals that provide a picture of soft tissues. 

### Activities of the Brain
- **EEG(electroencephalogram)** ::: An amplified recording of the waves of electrical activity sweeping across the brain's surface. These waves are measures by electrodes placed of the scalp. 脑电图
- **MEG(magnetoencephalography)** ::: A brain imaging technique that measures magnetic fields from the brain's natural electrical activity. 脑磁图
- **PET(positron emission tomography) scan** ::: A visual display of brain activity that detects where a radioactive form of glucose goes while the brain performs a given task. 正电子发射断层扫描 ![[Pasted image 20211018200444.png]]
	- To obtain a PET scan, researchers inject volunteers with a low and harmless dose of a short-lived radioactive sugar.
	- The detectors around the person's head pick up the release of gamma rays from the sugar. A computer can process and translates the signals from the active brain areas into a map of the brain at work.
- **fMRI(functional MRI)** ::: A technique for revealing bloodflow and then the brain activity by comparing successive  scans. fMRI shows both brain function and its structure. 


## Older Brain Structures

### The Brainstem
![[Pasted image 20211018203629.png]]
- **brainstem** ::: The oldest part and central core of the brain, beginning where the spinal cord swells as it enters the skull; the brainstem is responsible for automatic survival functions.
- **medulla** ::: The base of the brainstem; controls heartbeat and breathing.

**The Thalamus**
Thalamus is sitting atop of the brainstem, which is a pair of egg-shpaed structures that act as the brain's sensory control center.
- **thalamus** ::: The brain's sensory control center, located on top of the brainstem; it directs messages to the sensory receiving areas in the cortex and transmits replies to the cerebellum and medulla. 

**The Reticular Formation**
Inside the brainstem, between your ears, lies the **reticular("netlike") formation**, neuron network extending from the spinal cord right up through the thalamus.
- **reticular formation** ::: A nerve network that travels through the brainstem into the thalamus and plays an important role in controlling arousal. 

### The Cerebellum
Extending from the rear of the brainstem is the baseball-sized cerebellum, meaning "little brain".
- **cerebellum** ::: The "little brain" at the rear of the brainstem; functions include processing sensory input, coordinating movement output and balance, and enabling nonverbal learning and memory. ![[Pasted image 20211018205048.png]]

## The Limbic System
- **limbic system** ::: Neural system located below the cerebral hemispheres; associated with emotions and drives. ![[Pasted image 20211019125110.png]]
- **amygdala** ::: Two lima-bean-sized neural clusters in the limbic system; linked to emotion.
The amygdala lesions often display reduced arousal to fear- and anger-arounsing stimuli. The case S. M. has been called "the woman with no fear", even if being threatened with a gun.

- **hypothalamus** ::: A neural structure lying below the thalamus, which directs several maintenance activities and helps govern the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. It is linked to emotion and reward.
- **hippocampus** ::: Seahorse-shaped brain structure. A neural center located in the limbic system; helps process for storage explicit memories of facts and events. 

![[Pasted image 20211019130244.png]]
- **corpus callosum** : Axon fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres
- **reticular formation** : Helps control arousal
- **pons** : Helps coordinate movement and control sleep
- **medulla** : Controls heartbeat and breathing


## The Cerebral Cortex
- **cerebral cortex** ::: The intricate fabric of interconnected neural cells covering the cerebral hemispheres; the body's ultimate control and information-processing center.

### Structure of the Cortex
- **frontal lobes** ::: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying just behind the forehead; involved in speaking and muscle movement and in making plans and judgments.
- **parietal lobes** ::: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the top of the head and toward the rear; receives sensory input for touch and body position.
<!--SR:!2021-10-22,3,250-->
- **occipital lobes** ::: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the back of the head; include areas that receive the information from the visual fields.
- **temporal lobes** ::: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying roughly above the ears; includes the auditory areas, each receiving information primarily from the opposite ear.
-
