Position, Velocity and Acceleration
---
Assume the position of an object is $x$, the relationship between Position, Velocity and Acceleration is:
Position:$$f(x)$$Velocity:$$f'(x)$$Acceleration:$$f''(x)$$
While Physics 1 is Algebra only, so without Calculus, we can define that velocity is the slope, or rate of change of position, same relationship with acceleration, but use slope of velocity instead of position. Here is the algebra way to talk about this: 
Velocity:$$v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$Acceleration:$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$
So, based on those representations above, we can conclude that:$$\Delta v=a\Delta t$$ and $$\Delta x=v\Delta t$$

Due to the time situation, I don't want to type the process of deriving equation, but here are some fundamental equations we will use at the AP Exam:
$$v_{final}=v_{initial}+at$$$$x_{final}=x_{initial}+v_{initial}+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$$$v^2_{final}=v^2_{initial}+2a(x_{final}-x_{initial})$$


Representation of Motion
---
We use vectors (arrows) to represent the direction and magnitude of motion. Usually, we will have $\rightarrow$ or $\uparrow$ as positive direction, and $\leftarrow$ or $\downarrow$ as negative direction, so watch out those during test, it is different from our normal mathematics calculation.
