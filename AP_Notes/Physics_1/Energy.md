Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy
---
While object is moving, it contains ***Kinetic Energy*** and ***Potential Energy***. In physics 1, we have *Translational Kinetic Energy* and *Rotational Kinetic Energy*. For the friction ==Negligible== surface or non-rotational part of motion, we have the kinetic energy:$$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$The unit of energy is Joule.
There is also two potential energy in Physics 1. One is related to the height, which is gravitational potential$$U_g=mgh$$more precisely, the change of potential energy can be written by:$$\Delta U_g=mg\Delta h$$
We had also discussed something about spring, which the spring potential is $$U_s=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$k stands for spring constant, x is distance from spring's equilibrium point.

Work and Mechanical Energy
---
When a force is applied to an object over a displacement, **work** is  done to the object, we usually calculate the horizontal direction of the object, given the angle $\theta$ from displacement to the horizontal line, we have $$W=Fd\space \cos\theta$$ Which means, when there is a vertical movement, the work done in horizontal direction is 0.
Also, from the KE and PE we've discussed above, we need to add an addition rule to the world: The conservation of energy. In a close system, the Mechanical Energy is conserved, and $$E_{m}=KE+PE$$due to the conservation of energy in close system, we have$$K_i+U_i=K_f+U_f$$

Power
---
When work is done over some amount of time, we can measure the **power** or the rate at which the work is performed. Power is scalar with units of Watts: 1 Watt = 1 Joule/sec: $$P=\frac{W}{t}$$also $$Fv\cos\theta$$
