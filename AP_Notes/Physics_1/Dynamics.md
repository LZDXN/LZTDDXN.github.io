Systems
---
We have close and open systems in the universe, a close system means there is no external force input into of output from the system. Otherwise it is a open system.

The Gravitational Field
---
We are human, living on Earth. The force attract us on the Earth is the Gravitational Force, so that we have gravitational acceleration. Different planet has its different gravitational acceleration.

Contact Forces
---
The force exert from an object to another object by touch.

Newton's 1st law
---
Welcome to the *TRUE* macro-physics world by first get known the Newton's $1^{st}$ Law. The first law also called *Law of inertia*, for every object in the world, when the $F_{net}$ of the object is 0, the object is constant velocity or stay static.

Newton's 2nd law
---
The relationship of force, mass and acceleration: $$F=ma$$

Newton's 3rd law
--
When an object receive force, it will return opposite force to opposite direction it receive force.

Free-Body Diagrams
---
I am lazy to tell that since I don't have much time, but remember, when you draw a diagrams, the longer, or the thicker arrows, the strong force it represents.
