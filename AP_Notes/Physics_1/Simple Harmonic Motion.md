Period of Simple Harmonic Oscillators
---
Hook's Law
$$F_s=-kx$$

Energy of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator
---
When Object is at equilibrium point, its kinetic is maximum (P=0), when the object is at amplitude, its potential is maximum (K=0).

#### Period of spring
$$T=1/f$$and $$f=1/T$$
Variables that may affect the period ($T$) is showed by the equation:$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$m is object's mass and k is spring's constant.

#### Period of Pendulum
$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
L is the length of string, g is gravitational acceleration constant.
